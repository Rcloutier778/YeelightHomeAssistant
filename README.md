# YeelightHomeAssistant
UI and config files for Home Assistant dashboard. 

Acts as a command center for all my home automation needs. Displays AQM stats and can override the Yeelight lights both natively and via the REST API I have running on the raspberry pi. Displayed on a cheapo Amazon Fire tablet in kiosk mode mounted on my wall. 
Uses some elements from my air quality monitoring script.
